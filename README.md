# Alibi-Boston-Restaurant

http://alibiboston.surge.sh/

### What is this?

This is another bar/restaurant website that I created after observing modern design techniques used on the source website here:
https://www.alibiboston.com/

I re-recreated a minimalistic website by re-arranging the information around while preserving similar techniques used in the source website.

### My Thoughts/What I learned:

I was inspired by techniques like slideshow as background with opacity animation and the use of css flex images that fills out the layout of the web page. I learned about JavaScript's browser API Intersection Observable that lets you detect an element is visible or not as the user scrolls down the page. 

This website is my first experience with mobile-first design, which requires more extensive use of CSS more than my previous projects that I created.
