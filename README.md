# Alibi-Boston-Restaurant

http://alibiboston.surge.sh/

### What is this?

This is another bar/restaurant website that I created after observing modern design techniques used on the source website here:
https://www.alibiboston.com/

I re-recreated a minimalistic website by re-arranging the information to make something slightly different. 


### My Thoughts/What I learned:

I was inspired by techniques like slideshow as background with opacity animation and the use of css flex images that fills out the layout of the web page.

This website is my first experience with mobile-first design.
